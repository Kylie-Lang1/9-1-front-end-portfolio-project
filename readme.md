# Front End Project Portfolio
## Kylie Lang
I will create an app using the Trivia Questions API
###
In my app, there will be a  home page where users can select a category and difficulty level for the questions. After submitting an answer, the next question will be displayed. A final popup at the end will display the user's overall score.
