I will create an app using the Trivia Questions API
###
In my app, there will be a  home page where users can select a category and difficulty level or choose to randomly select questions.  There will also be a `Test my Knowledge` button that will choose questions with increasing difficulty if users answer questions correctly. A final page at the end will display the user's overall score.
