# Front End Project Portfolio
## Kylie Lang
This app is a trivia question game created using the jService API (https://jservice.io/)

[See assets for example of API data]
###
In my app, users can select a category and difficulty level for the questions. More difficult questions are worth more points. After submitting an answer, the correct answer will be revealed in green/red text indicating a correct or incorrect answer. The score will be updated and the next question will be displayed. A final popup at the end will display the user's overall score.

To get started, clone the repo to your local environment and right click the index.html file to Open with Live Server.
